### Overview of project

## OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
The objective of this Java program is to create a simple Library Management System that can manage resources such as books, magazines, and DVDs. It provides a basic interface for adding, searching, and managing library items, while supporting different user roles (e.g., librarian and patron). This system helps streamline library operations, making it easier to track items, manage checkouts/returns, and enforce fines for overdue items.

## Key feature of project
Resource Management:

Supports Various Item Types: Manages books, magazines, and DVDs as separate library resources.
Add, Search, and View Library Items: Allows users to add new items, search for specific items by title, and view the entire library collection.
User Role Management:

Different User Roles: Supports multiple user roles such as librarian (who can manage items) and patron (who can borrow items).
Role-Based Permissions: Librarians can add items, while patrons can only check out and return them.
Checkout and Return Functionality:

Check Out and Return Items: Allows patrons to check out items if available and return them when done.
Availability Tracking: Tracks each itemâ€™s status to determine if it's available for checkout.
Data Persistence:

File-Based Data Storage: Uses file handling to save and retrieve library data from a text file, ensuring data is retained between program sessions.
Load and Save Automatically: Loads data at startup and saves automatically after each operation.
Overdue Fine Management (can be expanded):

Basic Fine Calculation: Can be extended to include overdue fine calculation based on the return date.
User-Friendly Console Interface:

Interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI): Provides an easy-to-navigate console interface for adding items, searching, checking out, and returning items.
Simple Input Prompts: Clearly defined options make it easy for users to interact with the system.
